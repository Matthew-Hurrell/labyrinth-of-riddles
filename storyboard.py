    Greetings adventurer!

    Welcome to the Labyrinth of Riddles.

    Only the truly worthy can succeed in completing the Labyrinth.

    Navigate the maze and answer the riddles correctly to prove yourself
    worthy of claiming the legendary treasure within its walls.

    But beware! Many brave explorers who venture into the labyrinth
    never return.

    Not a single sound can be heard.

    Only the faint crackle of the torches that light the dim walkways.

    You feel the gravel crunch beneath your feet as you take a breath
    and enter the labyrinth.

    The walls are thick stone bricks which extend up far beyond reach.

    The stones are old and sticky to the touch.

    Before you are two paths.

    One path continues straight and the other follows the outer ring
    of the labyrinth to the left.

    The Ridder."

    continue to walk forwards.

    As you walk further into the passageway, you hear an audible click as
    one of your feet touches a panel on the floor.

    "Ah crap, why did I go left?!"

    Before you have time to react, you hear the whip of hundreds of arrows

    in desperation.

    You are almost there.

    as it wraps tightly around you, stopping you in your tracks.

    cloak pulls you in and covers you.

    Helpless to escape, you feel the hood of the cloak slowly rise over the
    back of your head and over your face.

    your riddles and proves themselves worthy.
